# Protection Strategy

## Brand Architecture

```
0nORK (Parent Entity)
├── 0nMCP (Product Brand)
│   └── MCP Orchestrator (First Product)
├── 0n-spec (The .0n Standard)
└── Future Products...
```

## Trademarks

File for:
- **0nORK** — Parent company name
- **0nMCP** — Product brand for MCP tools
- **MCP Orchestrator** — First product name
- **.0n** — The configuration standard

## Namespace Protection

### Domains
- 0nork.com
- 0nmcp.com

### Social Handles
- GitHub: @0nork
- Twitter: @0nMCP
- Discord: 0nMCP

### Package Managers
- npm: `0nmcp`, `0n-spec`
- PyPI: `0nmcp` (reserve)

## Community Moat

### Week 1 Goals
- Discord server with active channels
- GitHub Discussions enabled on all repos
- Twitter presence with daily posts
- Dev.to / Hashnode blog posts

### Ongoing
- Ship 5+ new service integrations per week
- Respond to all issues within 24 hours
- Weekly changelog / release notes
- Monthly community showcase

## Technical Moat

- Ship faster than any fork can follow
- Deep service integrations (CRM has 10 dedicated tools)
- The .0n standard creates ecosystem lock-in (positive)
- Community contributions flow back to main

## Monetization (Open Core)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Core orchestrator, all tools, unlimited local use |
| **Pro** | $29/mo | Cloud execution, scheduled tasks, webhooks, history dashboard |
| **Team** | $99/mo | Shared connections, team workflows, audit log, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | SSO, custom integrations, SLA, dedicated support |

### Revenue Streams
1. SaaS subscriptions (Pro/Team/Enterprise)
2. Marketplace fees (10% on brain/workflow sales)
3. Enterprise contracts
4. Sponsored integrations

## Competitive Response

### If a direct competitor appears:
1. Ship faster
2. Integrate deeper
3. Grow community
4. Stay open source
5. The .0n standard is our moat — once tools adopt it, switching cost is real

### If a big company copies it:
1. We own the standard
2. We own the community
3. Open source can't be out-competed on trust
4. Enterprise customers value community + history
